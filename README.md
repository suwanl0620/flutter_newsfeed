# flutter_newsfeed
Basic newsfeed app using Flutter and Firebase

RUNNING APP
- I was not able to get the app running on my machine, it is likely due to a set-up error with my Flutter environment or authentication token with Firebase, I am still trying to pinpoint the root cause of the issue.

DESIGN CHOICES
- Design choices in regards to proportion was largely from tutorials on Youtube as well as suggestions from Copilot

- Color choice of warm, light orange palette was made based on knowledge that it is the most inviting color, which makes sense for a social media app
